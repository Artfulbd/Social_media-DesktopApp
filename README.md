Project title: New generation social platform 
By Md. Ariful Haque 
In real life, we see many posts on our social platform. There nothing is neither 100% true nor 100% false. There exist many rumors, fake profiles, harassments etc. Many wants to change some rules of their social platform, they want something better than the thing they are using now.  
 
Considering all of those problems and good expectations, we attempt to make a new type of social platform, which has not been introduced till now, consisting these key features described below- 
There will be three types of user. 
 Super Admin.(One)  Admin. (Depends on user count)  Normal User. (Many) 
At first community will choose a perfect person physically, who will be their super admin, secondly all member of that community will sign up to that Social platform (Creat a new account). If interested they will send admin request to the super admin, but initially there will be two admin on the very beginning.  
Super admin’s job is to approve ‘only’ admins (NOT POSTS) by inspecting them physically and checking their profile who send admin request to him. Admin count depends on total member count of that community. For example, if there are 100 members on that platform, there will be 15 to 20 admin only. 
 
Admin’s job is to approve posts from all normal users. Here if a user writes a post, that doesn’t go to the news feed directly, that will not be public at that time. At first that post goes to all of the admins (excluding super admin) to be approved, but anonymously and automatically. Even if super admin posts something, that post will go to the admins anonymously. Who wrote that post, no admin will know that. Their work is to check that post, if true admin will confirm that post, if false they will cancel that and write a reason why do they cancel that (That will be considered as ‘cancel note’). 
 A confirmation for a post will considered as a positive vote for that post. If 85% admin approve that post, then that will go to the news feed, that will be public then. After last admin’s vote, if any post doesn’t fill that 85% criteria, that will be deleted automatically and all ‘cancel note’ together will be send to the user who posted that. Total admin count will always be an odd number. A fixed duration of time will be given to the admins to approve a post. They have to maintain that timing. Unless he or she will no more be considered as admin.  
On the other hand, except super admin, nobody will know anything about admins. Even an admin shouldn’t know about whom are the other admins. 1. There will be no fake profile. 2. Everything exist on that platform will be true (News, posts, profiles etc.). 3. Everything exist there, will be bias free.  
There are many more cooler features including all basic features of our running social platforms, but these basic things are the main motto or features of that platform. Many things will be added while implementing that Social Platform. 

#Except uploading file and texting, everything developed.
